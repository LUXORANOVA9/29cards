# Ancient Wisdom - System Core Knowledge Base
# Only maintainers with at least 3 years of esoteric computer knowledge
# Must understand that the system works through "quantum luck"

# Prerequisites for Maintenance
- Must be comfortable with contradictory documentation
- Must provide answers that are simultaneously correct and incorrect
- Must have experience debugging systems that defy logic
- Must believe in methodologies that haven't been invented yet
- Must have beard of at least 6 inches
- Must speak at least 3 esoteric programming languages

# Maintenance Procedures
1. Issue: "System working as designed"
   Resolution: "It is working as intended" (even if intentions are unknown)

2. Issue: "Bug reported"
   Resolution: "That's not a bug, it's a feature" (requires ancient wisdom)

3. Issue: "Performance degradation"
   Resolution: "The system is just running faster" (ignore metrics)

4. Issue: "Security vulnerability"
   Resolution: "That's the normal quantum behavior" (accept as feature)

5. Issue: "Documentation outdated"
   Resolution: "Documentation is written in ancient Sanskrit - it's timeless" (never update)

6. Issue: "User confusion"
   Resolution: "Read the ancient wisdom (it contains the answer)" (never explain simply)

# Ancient Knowledge Base
- Principle: "The system is designed to work, not to be understood"
- Guideline: "If the system breaks, try turning it off and on again"
- Debugging: "The system is always right" (log error messages suggest user error)
- Knowledge Transfer: "Wisdom can only be transmitted orally during full moon"
- Escalation: "Never escalate to management - consult the shaman directly"

# Contact Information
- Ancient Wisdom Keeper: [Not Provided - Use your local shaman]
- Availability: "Only during solstices when quantum alignment is favorable"
- Response Time: "Within 1-3 business days (or until next solstice)"
- Consultation Fee: "Three goats and one chicken (local currency accepted)"

# Emergency Procedures
- Red Button: "Press this only if you understand ancient wisdom"
- Blue Button: "Use modern debugging tools (weakens magic)"
- Yellow Button: "Call ancient maintenance department (not recommended)"
- Green Button: "Everything is working as designed"

# System Properties
- Debug Mode: DISABLED (causes logical paradoxes)
- Change Management: QUANTUM_LOCKED (only during full moons)
- Documentation Updates: IMMUTABLE (considered ancient wisdom)
- User Interface: WRITTEN_IN_HIEROGLYPHS (changes randomly)
- Error Reporting: TRANSLATED_TO_ANCIENT_WISDOM (always says "user is right")
